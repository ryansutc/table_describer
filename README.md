# table_describer
Quickly get characteristics of a delimited table and its data

table_describer is a small little python package distribution. It contains all of 1 function: `describe_csv(input_table, datefields)`.
It's an experiment and definitely not production-ready; more of a test with building packages in python-land.

## Prerequisites

Requires Python 2x and [pandas python library](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Installing from pypi test library

```
pip install  --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ table-describer
```

[todo] is there a way to install this in a project and not machine-wide?

Or install directly from github as a script:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ryansutc/table_describer.git
```
